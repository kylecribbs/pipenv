# PEEP-042: Specify Alternate Index for dev

Allow a [[source]] to be tied to --dev not jut a single package.

â˜¤
When a user does pipenv install --dev it would install the dev packages with someurl.org/simple/ and the regular packages would install with pypi.org/simple/.

A good use case is Continuous Integration pipelines. During the build phase a user may want to look at their personal pypi index (--dev) and during the deploy stage or if someone pulls down their code it would specify the PyPi index.

```
[[source]]
name = "pypi"
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

[[source]]
name = "home"
url = "https://someurl.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
**use_with = "dev"**

[dev-packages] 
pylint = "*"

[packages]
flask

[requires]
python_version = "3.7"
```

In this case pipenv install --dev would look at https://someurl.org/simple for pylint and install flask from pypi.org.
